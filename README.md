# TravelPlans
The Front-Facing Portal for My Travel Plans

## Purpose
This is mostly a website for viewing plans & summaries of my European travels. That being said, there is some code here:
- JavaScript
  - I use JavaScript for simple website editing. Note that all my HTML is home-grown and hand made with care.
  - I also use some plugins:
    - HammerJS
    - jQuery
    - Bootstrap
- C#
  - I use C# for _Converter_, which is documented a bit more later.
- HTML
  - This is of course not a programming language, but it should be noted that all HTML is hand-typed - *none* of it was automatically generated! If you like the look of the website, please, feel free to reach out to me...
  

## Converter
Converter is written in C#, and converts my simple text files into nice, readable HTML files.
